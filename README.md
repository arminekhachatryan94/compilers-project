## Features

- Non-Trivial Feature #2: Access Modifiers
                        
- Non-Trivial Feature #3: Generic Programming
                
- Work Planned for Custom Milestone: Generics

## Type Checker
- Variables have the correct type when assigned

- Variables are defined when assigned

- Expressions evaluate to the correct type

- Variables have the correct access for the current scope

- Classes have the correct access for the current scope

- Return is called in a method

- Break is called only within a while loop or if statement

- Classes must have unique name

- Variables must have unique name

- Function calls take expected parameters of expected types
